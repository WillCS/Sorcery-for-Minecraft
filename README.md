# Sorcery

Sorcery is a mod I made for Minecraft. I start worked on it when I was 13 and continued building it on and off for the next few years. I had made mods before but nothing nearly of this scale, so this was my first significant programming project. (That means the code is gonna be **bad**) 

I never really finished it but I put a lot of work into this back in the day and I thought I'd put it here for posterity.

I'll fill the rest of this in with some screenshots and info soon.
